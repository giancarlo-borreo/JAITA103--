        <h2>A NEW HOPE</h2>
      <p>It is a period of civil war. Rebel spaceships,</p>
      <p>striking from a hidden base, have won their first</p>
      <p>victory against the evil Galactic Empire.</p>
      <p>During the battle, Rebel spies managed to steal</p>
      <p>secret plans to the Empire's ultimate weapon, the</p>
      <p>Death Star, an armored space station with enough</p>
      <p>power to destroy an entire planet.</p>
      <p>Pursued by the Empire's sinister agents, Princess</p>
      <p>Leia races home aboard her starship, custodian of</p>
      <p>the stolen plans that can save her people and</p>
      <p>restore freedom to the galaxy...</p>
